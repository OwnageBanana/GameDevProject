# GameDevProject
Game dev 2017

This was a course project where we wuild a simple game using the Unity game engine. the core idea is a city builder which builds itself, you're an AI meant to manage resources for a group of the worlds dumbest people who've been sent to colonize space. They act against yo at every turn while random events take place at the smae time throwing a wrench in the plan. the group of people will revolt against the AI, blaming it for all the negative things which take place, eventually destroying you and in turn damning themselves if they get too upset.

The goal of this course project was to build a game from bottom to top starting with revisions of a game design document detailing key points, core game loop, story, mechanics, etc,.
